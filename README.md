# COMET-LozolEnlistment

Done for the COMET Term 1 Assessment. A mock university enlistment in command line using fundamental Python.
In-progress. Currently learning Python basics along with fundamental pythonic coding.

# Insights

I actually had a bit of fun learning through Python. It was weird to see the practices that Python coders did like Ask Forgiveness Not Permission instead of Look Before You Leap and a lot of things being falsy (empty containers like sets, lists, dictionaries). Definitely gives me more insight on people that say Python is a good beginner language. I actually agree, but it kind of gives a bad introduction to other languages. Python is also harder if you're already used to more static languages like Java and C (like we have been using before).

# Learnings

+ Reading through documentation properly
+ Looking through best practices in the community
+ Being consistent in doing work
+ Actually using (kind of) basic version control (again, kind of)
+ ~~Why is Python so confusing?~~
+ ~~Why did I decide to use .txt instead of looking for another option?~~
